We calculated standart deviation with the following amount of inputs: 10, 1000, 1 000 000. 
Based on the profiler output, the program spends the most time in the 
variance_function function.

Therefore, the best place to focus on optimizing the code would be in the 
variance_function by potentially optimizing the mathematical calculations 
being performed.
