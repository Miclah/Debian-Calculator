# Windows 10 Inspired Calculator

This project is a Python-based calculator application inspired by the layout, colors, and functionalities of the Windows 10 calculator. It provides a simple yet intuitive interface for performing basic arithmetic operations and some advanced mathematical functions.

## About

This calculator application was created as a project for an academic subject. The layout, design, and basic functionalities closely resemble those of the Windows 10 calculator. The project aimed to implement a similar user interface while also incorporating additional features and customization options.

## Disclaimer

This repository is a copy of a private repository used for academic purposes. While I primarily contributed to the graphical user interface (GUI) aspect of the calculator, the overall project involved collaboration with other team members who contributed to different components and functionalities.

## Features

- Basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- Advanced mathematical functions (factorial, power, square root, natural logarithm)
- Support for parentheses in mathematical expressions
- Input via both mouse clicks and keyboard input
- Tutorial window for guiding users on using the calculator

## Usage

- To use the calculator, simply run the `gui.py` script using Python or you can install the application on Debian-based systems using the provided Debian installer package. Simply download the package and follow the installation instructions. The calculator window will open, allowing you to input mathematical expressions and perform calculations. 
- Additionally, you can access the tutorial window by clicking the "?" button in the title bar.
